# Optimization problems
a problem with > 1 possible solutions, in which each solution has a value
- goal is to find an optimal solution
- optimal solution
    - a solution with the optimal (min/max) value
    - enough to satisfy the given constrain of the problem
- non-optimal solution
    - solutions other than the optimal solution

# Dynamic programming
- a dag
- solving the subproblems in order using a relation which involves only smaller/appeared earlier subproblems

# Greedy
