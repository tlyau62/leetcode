Object Oriented Analysis and Design

# Definition
Analysis
> Emphasize an investigation of the problem and requirements of the domain, rather than a solution

Design
> Emphasize a conceptual solution that fulfils the requirements, rather than its implementation

OO analysis
> Emphasize on finding and describing the objects or concepts in the problem domain

OO design
> Emphasize on defining software objects and their collaboration for fulfilling the requirements

Domain
> the real world

# OO philosophy
- Objects exist in nature, thus OO technology reflects Real world scenario
- OO thinking is in abstraction level (should not be intoxicated with technological implementation)
- OO leads to reuse of components/sub-systems (Component Based Development model)

# OO Concept and Principles
## Abstraction and Encapsulation
Abstraction
> hide the details and shows the essentials to the user 

Encapsulation
> bind together as a single unit

## Classes and Objects
Class
> encapsulate the data and procedural abstractions required to describe the content and behaviour of some domain entity

Attributes
> implement the data abstraction
> hide the particular values from the domain

Operations/methods/services
> implement the procedural abstraction
> hide the particular logic from the domain
