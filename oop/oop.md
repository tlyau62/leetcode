Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- a method of implementation in which programs are organized as cooperative collections of objects, each of which represents an 
instance of some class, and whose classes are all members of a hierarchy of classes united via inheritance relationships
- three important parts to this definition
  1. Object-oriented programming uses objects, not algorithms, as its fundamental logical building blocks (the "part of" hierarchy we introduced in Chapter 1)
  2. each object is an instance of some class
  3. classes may be related to one another via inheritance relationships (the "is a" hierarchy we spoke of in Chapter 1)

"part of" hierarchy vs "is a" hierarchy

OOP vs Algorithm

Object-oriented design (OOD)
- Object-oriented design is a method of design encompassing the process of object-
oriented decomposition and a notation for depicting both logical and physical as 
well as static and dynamic models of the system under design
