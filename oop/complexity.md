# The Five Attributes of a Complex System
1. Hierarchic Structure (Hierarchical)
>Frequently, complexity takes the form of a hierarchy, whereby a complex system is composed of interrelated subsystems that have in turn their own subsystems, and so on, until some lowest level of elementary components is reached.
2. Relative Primitives (Multiple levels of abstraction)
>The choice of what components in a system are primitive is relatively arbitrary and is largely up to the discretion of the observer of the system.
3. Separation of Concerns (Decomposable)
>Intracomponent linkages are generally stronger than intercomponent linkages. This fact has the effect of separating the high-frequency dynamics of the components—involving the internal structure of the components—from the low-frequency dynamics—involving interaction among components.
4. Common Patterns (Reuse of common patterns)
>Hierarchic systems are usually composed of only a few different kinds of sub-
systems in various combinations and arrangements
5. Stable Intermediate Forms (Evolutionary)
>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked... A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.
