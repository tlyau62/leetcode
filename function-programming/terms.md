## functional programming (fp)
programming paradigm

## pure function
A pure function is a function that, given the same input, will always return the same output and does not have any observable side effect.

A pure function is a function that can be memorized.

## side effect
A side effect is a change of system state or observable interaction with the outside world that occurs during the calculation of a result.

## currying
You can call a function with fewer arguments than it expects. It returns a function that takes the remaining arguments

## partial application
the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity

## pointfree style
a programming paradigm in which function definitions do not identify the arguments (or "points") on which they operate

## referential transparent
an expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior

## category theory
Category theory is an abstract branch of mathematics that can formalize concepts from several different branches such as set theory, type theory, group theory, logic, and more

## a category
components
- a collection of objects
- a collection of morphisms
- a notion of composition on the morphisms
- a distinguished morphism called identity
